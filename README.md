# Microfrontend Architecture Research Example

This project demonstrates various aspects of microfrontend architecture through a practical implementation. It showcases how different teams can work independently while maintaining a cohesive user experience.

## Project Structure

```
packages/
├── host/           # Container application
├── mfe1/           # Microfrontend 1 (Product Catalog)
├── mfe2/           # Microfrontend 2 (Shopping Cart)
└── shared/         # Shared components and utilities
```

## Research Aspects Demonstrated

### 1. Technical Independence and Team Autonomy
- Each microfrontend is a separate package with its own dependencies
- Teams can choose their own development tools and practices
- Independent deployment cycles

### 2. Technology Flexibility
- Support for different frameworks (React, Vue, etc.)
- Independent technology choices per team
- Framework-agnostic communication patterns

### 3. Incremental Upgrades and Risk Reduction
- Isolated deployment of individual features
- Gradual migration path
- Independent versioning

### 4. Build-Time Integration
- Module Federation for build-time integration
- Shared dependencies optimization
- Build-time type checking

### 5. Runtime Integration via JavaScript
- Dynamic loading of microfrontends
- Runtime communication patterns
- Event-based architecture

### 6. Web Components
- Framework-agnostic components
- Shadow DOM encapsulation
- Custom element definitions

### 7. Shared State Management
- Cross-microfrontend state management
- Event-based communication
- Shared context patterns

### 8. Performance Overhead
- Lazy loading of microfrontends
- Shared dependency optimization
- Performance monitoring

### 9. Styling and Design Consistency
- Shared design system
- CSS-in-JS solutions
- Theme consistency

### 10. Team Structure Alignment
- Clear ownership boundaries
- Independent team workflows
- Cross-team collaboration patterns

### 11. Documentation and Governance
- Clear integration patterns
- API documentation
- Versioning strategy

### 12. Learning Curve and Developer Experience
- Developer tooling
- Local development setup
- Debugging strategies

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start the development servers:
```bash
npm start
```

3. Access the applications:
- Host: http://localhost:3000
- MFE1: http://localhost:3001
- MFE2: http://localhost:3002

## Development

Each microfrontend can be developed independently:

```bash
# Start individual applications
npm run start:host
npm run start:mfe1
npm run start:mfe2
```

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

## Contributing

Each team should:
1. Work within their designated microfrontend
2. Follow the established communication patterns
3. Maintain backward compatibility
4. Document their changes
